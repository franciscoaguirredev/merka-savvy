# MerkaSavvy

## Why?
This project has been created to address the challenge that any person has to face when it is time to buy the groceries or any particular daily basis item. We realized that everyone who is trying to go shopping to feed our families at the end of the month is hard for us to remember what we have on our fridge or cupboard and we end buying something that we already have and we don´t need and that always affects our budget. Or we end totally forgetting what we really need and it´s missing in our home. For that reason we decided to developed MerkaSavvy a software solution to all those problems.

## What for?
The purpose of this project is to give a solution that allows our users to track the input and the output of what they usually buy and eat in their household and make it easier for them to remember what they have to buy and where to buy it, based on their own history. We want to impact huundreds of thousands of people who want an easier and mre tidy experience for their personal finances and purchases.

## Whom for?
This project is aimed at anyone, of any age, of any profession who wants to optimize their daily shopping experience of their household goods. Most of the users who are young adults who are not living with their parents anymore and are starting to live by their own and want to start to keep the order in their live will find this very interesting and useful.

## Chosen Category
The category of this project is personal finances and logistics because we don´t force the user to enter only household items, It can track any kind of product the user wants. We chose this category because is currently relevant for everybody and affects our personal lives. Our solution is focused on be useful and improve the personal and family finances.
